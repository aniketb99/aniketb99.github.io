title : 🚀 Welcome to Aniket's Data Odyssey 
---

Hello there, digital explorer! I am Aniket—a seasoned Data Scientist passionate about diving deep into the ocean of numbers, patterns, and predictions. My journey is a story of traversing through the vastness of data, distilling wisdom, and illuminating the unknown with actionable insights.

## 🧠 Expertise & Achievements 

- **Time Traveler's Tools**: I've mastered the intricacies of Time Series Analysis, wielding powerful statistical models such as ARMA, ARIMA, and GARCH to understand temporal data and predict future trends. Whether it's stock market volatility or seasonal sales, I've got it covered.
- **Forecasting Maestro**: From inventory optimization to predictive maintenance, I employ techniques like Survival Analysis and Forecasting to ensure businesses run smoothly, machinery lasts longer, and unexpected hiccups are, well, expected.
- **Machine Learning Maverick**: My ML journey spans across theoretical and applied arenas. I've implemented powerhouse algorithms from XGBoost to neural embeddings. If data is the oil, consider my algorithms the refinery, converting raw information into rocket fuel for business growth.
- **Big Data Wrangler**: Managing colossal datasets isn't for the faint-hearted. But with experience in scripting, configuring instances, and deploying data pipelines for production, I've honed the art of herding these digital beasts.
- **Trusted By Giants**: Having collaborated with multiple Fortune 50 clients, I've not only scaled mountains of data but also ensured that insights resonate with stakeholders, from board rooms to tech hubs.

## 🛠 Toolbox

- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost, Embeddings, Supervised ML Techniques.
- **Statistical Modeling**: ARMA, ARIMA, GARCH, Survival Analysis.
- **Data Engineering**: Large-scale data handling, scripting, instance configuration.
- **Deployment**: Crafting and orchestrating production-ready pipelines.
